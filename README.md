#Simple-Prey-Predator-Simulation
Welcome to the Simple-Prey-Predator-Simulation repository! This project simulates the interactions between prey and predators within a defined environment, showcasing basic principles of ecology and population dynamics.

This simulation models the interaction between prey and predators in a simple, two-dimensional environment. The prey and predators move around the grid, with predators hunting the prey and prey trying to avoid predators. The simulation demonstrates basic concepts of predator-prey dynamics, including population growth and decline.

Features
Grid-based environment: The simulation takes place on a 2D grid.
Random movement: Prey and predators move randomly within the environment.
Interaction rules: Predators hunt prey, reducing the prey population upon successful capture.
Population tracking: The simulation tracks and displays population changes over time.
Installation
To run this simulation locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Greninja9257/Simple-Prey-Predator-Simulation.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd Simple-Prey-Predator-Simulation
Usage
To start the simulation, run the python script. For example:

sh
Copy code
python prey-predator-sim.py
The simulation will display the grid and update it in real-time, showing the movements and interactions of prey and predators.
